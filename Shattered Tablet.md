Shattered Tablet

Deep in an ancient tomb, you've discovered a stone tablet with secret information on the locations of other relics. However, while dodging a poison dart, it slipped from your hands and shattered into hundreds of pieces. Can you reassemble it and read the clues?
```

To start off I decided to run the program attached with Ghidra on DogBolt 
https://dogbolt.org

This is a list of char used in the flag that we need to unscramble 
I noticed that the tabletâ€™s variables are listed in order. So I deleted all the program related language from it leaving each number assignment to the characters.

Next I replaced the numbers in order to make it sort in the correct blocks.

```bash
sort listV2.txt
```

Now all that is left is to extract the sorted lists characters!
```bash
sort listV2.txt >> listV3.txt
```

```bash
cat listV3.txt | awk -F\' '{printf $2}'
```

```

```
